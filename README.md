## Installation 

No installation necessary. The site can be accessed here: https://jesscru.github.io/password-generator/.

## Usage 

This page will, upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, generate a password for the user based on responses to a series of questions concerning the password's character type and length. The user will be asked whether they would like their password to include lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers in addition to the length they would like their password (in terms of character number). The user will have to choose a password with a character length of at least 8 and it may not exceed 128 charaters. The user's desired password characteristics will be placed into the textarea for their use. The following is what the user will view upon navigating to the website:
